BASIC QUESTIONS :

1. Can you code outside a class in Java?
2. What are documentation comments and their use case?
3. What is the purpose of static keyword in Java?
4. Does Java have different memory width for integers on different machines like C, such as integer can be 2 bytes or 4 bytes depending on the compiler or machine itself?
5. What is the purpose of private and protected?
6. What are methods in Java?
7. What is the byte keyword?
8. What is specific about classname and filenames in java?
9. What is the purpose of import keyword?
10. What do you mean by JVM?
11. What is the difference between IO Buffer and Scanner?
12. Can a Java program run without a constructor? Also explain what a constructor is
13. Why do we use super?
14. Which class would typically hold more information - superclass or subclass? (You all can read about inheritance in specific by yourself - it's more of a word play than a basic understanding)
15. How do you use pointers in Java?
16. How do you use printf in Java? (Underestand the System.out.println() more clearly - it's very helpful)
17. Why is the main function always static?
18. How do you use this keyword?
19. Differenciate between parsing and type casting. Also discuss types of type casting.
20. Explain construct of Array2String method.


PROGRAMS :

1. Write a program using static function to calculate sum of square of N numbers using recursion
2. Write a program that converts alphabets to their respective characters counting index such as a-1, b-2, and so on, and leaves the rest of the characters as it is. (PS - constrained to small alphabets only). For example - hello238 becomes 85121215234 where 234 stays the same, h becomes it's corresponding 8 and so on...
3. Write a program to divide N equally in 3. You can use Math.ceil and Math.floor functions to round off to +1 or -1 depending on need. Example - 10 to be divided into 3, you have 3, 3, 4. 11 - 3, 4, 4 and so on.
